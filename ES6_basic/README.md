##  Objectives

`What is ES6?`  
ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) is a major update to JavaScript that introduced modern features to simplify and enhance development.

`New features introduced in ES6:`  
Key updates include let and const, arrow functions, template literals, default parameters, rest and spread operators, classes, modules, and promises.

`The difference between a constant and a variable:`  
A constant (const) cannot be reassigned after its declaration, whereas a variable (let or var) can be modified.

`Block-scoped variables:`  
Variables declared with let or const are limited to the block in which they are defined, offering improved safety over var.

`Arrow functions and function parameters default to them: ` 
Arrow functions provide concise syntax and automatically bind this. Default parameters allow functions to have predefined values for arguments if none are supplied.

`Rest and spread function parameters: `  
Rest parameters group multiple arguments into an array, while spread parameters unpack arrays or objects into individual elements.

`String templating in ES6: `  
Template literals simplify string interpolation by embedding variables and expressions directly in strings using backticks (``).

`Object creation and their properties in ES6: `  
Shorthand syntax allows you to create objects by automatically pairing identical keys and variables.

`Iterators and for-of loops: `  
Iterators enable custom iteration over collections, and for-of loops provide a simple way to iterate through iterable objects.

# Requirements
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `node 20.x.x` and `npm 9.x.x`
- Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the js extension
- Your code will be tested using the `Jest Testing Framework`
- Your code will be analyzed using the linter `ESLint` along with specific rules that we’ll provide
- All of your functions must be exported

## Exercices

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0. Const or let` | Modify function taskFirst to instantiate variables using const function taskNext to instantiate variables using let.|
| `1. Block Scope` | Given what you’ve read about var and hoisting, modify the variables inside the function taskBlock so that the variables aren’t overwritten inside the conditional block.|
| `2. Arrow functions` | Rewrite the following standard function to use ES6’s arrow syntax of the function add (it will be an anonymous function after)|
| `3. Parameter defaults` | Condense the internals of the following function to 1 line - without changing the name of each function/variable.
| `4. Rest parameter syntax for functions` | Modify the following function to return the number of arguments passed to it using the rest parameter syntax|
| `5. The wonders of spread syntax` | Using spread syntax, concatenate 2 arrays and each character of a string by modifying the function below. Your function body should be one line long.|
| `6. Take advantage of template literals` | Rewrite the return statement to use a template literal so you can the substitute the variables you’ve defined. |
| `7. Object property value shorthand syntax` | Modify the following function’s budget object to simply use the object property value shorthand syntax instead|
| `8. No need to create empty objects before adding in properties` | Rewrite the getBudgetForCurrentYear function to use ES6 computed property names on the budget object|
| `9. ES6 method properties` | Rewrite getFullBudgetObject to use ES6 method properties in the fullBudget object|
| `10. For...of Loops` | Rewrite the function appendToEachArrayValue to use ES6’s for...of operator. And don’t forget that var is not ES6-friendly.|
| `11. Iterator` | Write a function named createEmployeesObject that will receive two arguments:|
| `12. Let's create a report object` | Write a function named createReportObject whose parameter, employeesList, is the return value of the previous function createEmployeesObject.|
