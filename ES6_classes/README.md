##  Objectives

`How to define a class:` Use the class keyword followed by the class name and an optional constructor to initialize its properties.

`How to add methods to a class:` Define methods directly within the body of the class to perform actions or manipulate its properties.

`Why and how to add a static method to a class:` Static methods are associated with the class itself, not its instances. Use the static keyword to define them for utility or global functions.

`How to extend a class from another:` Use the extends keyword to inherit properties and methods from a parent class and customize the child class.

`Metaprogramming and symbols` Metaprogramming allows dynamic manipulation of object behaviors via tools like Proxy and Reflect. Symbols are unique identifiers used to create non-colliding, private properties in objects.
