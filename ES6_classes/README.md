##  Objectives

`How to define a class:` Use the class keyword followed by the class name and an optional constructor to initialize its properties.

`How to add methods to a class:` Define methods directly within the body of the class to perform actions or manipulate its properties.

`Why and how to add a static method to a class:` Static methods are associated with the class itself, not its instances. Use the static keyword to define them for utility or global functions.

`How to extend a class from another:` Use the extends keyword to inherit properties and methods from a parent class and customize the child class.

`Metaprogramming and symbols` Metaprogramming allows dynamic manipulation of object behaviors via tools like Proxy and Reflect. Symbols are unique identifiers used to create non-colliding, private properties in objects.

## Exercices

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0. You used to attend a place like this at some point`|Implement a class named ClassRoom.|
| `1. Let's make some classrooms`|Implement a function named initializeRooms. It should return an array of 3 ClassRoom objects with the sizes 19, 20, and 34 (in this order).|
| `2. A Course, Getters, and Setters`|The HolbertonCourse class has name, length, and students attributes, validated for type, stored privately (e.g., _name), with getters and setters.|
| `3. Methods, static methods, computed methods names..... MONEY`|Implement the Currency class with code and name attributes (stored as _code and _name), getters, setters, and a displayFullCurrency method returning name (code).|
| `4. Pricing`|Implement the Pricing class with _amount and _currency attributes, getters, setters, a displayFullPrice method, and a static convertPrice.|
| `5. A Building`|Create an abstract class Building with a sqft attribute (stored as _sqft), a getter for it, and ensure any subclass implements evacuationWarningMessage, throwing an error if not overridden.|
| `6. Inheritance`|Create SkyHighBuilding, extending Building, with sqft and floors as private attributes. Add getters and override evacuationWarningMessage to return: Evacuate slowly the NUMBER_OF_FLOORS floors.|
| `7. Airport`|Create a class Airport with attributes name and code stored as private (_name and _code). Redefine its default string description (toString) to return the airport code.|
| `8. Primitive - Holberton Class` |Class HolbertonClass: _size (Number) and _location (String). Cast to Number → returns size. Cast to String → returns location|
| `9. Hoisting`|Fix this code and make it work.|
| `10. Vroom`| Class Car with _brand, _motor, and _color as private attributes. Includes a cloneCar method to return a new instance of the class.|
